An open-source Python library for color generation, conversion, and retrieval of common properties, palettes, and color information.

### Changes in version 1.0.5:
- New conversion methods for `XYZ` / `CIE 1931 XYZ`.

### Changes in version 1.0.4:
- Updated `colors.py` with 500+ new color names to map to.

### Changes in version 1.0.3:
- Created new functions for the `analiysis` module. Including `rgb_to_linear`, and other functions to return more color properties, like luminance and vibrancy. We've also added new functions to calculate the color contrast ratio between to colors, and an accessibility function to return if foreground text color should be `light`, or `dark`, based on the background color.
- Created a new `blend_colors` function in our `conversions` module, to blend 2 RGB colors based on a given ratio. Also created new color conversion functions to convert each format into another target format, instead of just `RGB`.
- Added 3 more color schemes to `palettes`. Created new functions under the `ColorPalette` class, for random color generation, and a batch HEX color generation function.

> [!TIP]
> Most functions rely on the **RGB** color format, but you can quickly convert between RGB, and other color formats, using the functions provided in the `conversions` module.

## Installation

You can install Hued using pip:

```bash
pip install hued
```

## Supported Python Versions

Hued supports the following Python versions:

- Python 3.6
- Python 3.7
- Python 3.8
- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11 or later

Please ensure that one of these Python versions is installed before using Hued. Hued may not work as expected on lower versions of Python than the supported.

## Features

- Color Generation: Generate random colors and palettes.
- Color Conversion: Convert between different color formats (RGB, HEX, HSL, etc.).
- Color Properties: Retrieve properties like brightness, temperature, and whether a color is muted, pastel, or vibrant.
- Color Names: Get relevant color names, based on HEX values, and convert between color names and HEX values.

## Usage

### Color Properties

```python
from hued.colors import ColorManager

# Initialize the color manager
color_manager = ColorManager()

# Generate a random color
colorBlue = color_manager.get_color_by_name("Blue");

print("Blue Hex:", colorBlue.get("Hex"));
```

> You can view more properties by going to Hued's [package documentation](https://infinitode-docs.gitbook.io/documentation/package-documentation/hued-package-documentation)

### Color Conversion

```python
from hued.conversions import hex_to_rgb, rgb_to_hsl

# Convert HEX to RGB
rgb_color = hex_to_rgb("FF0000"); # Red
print(f"Hex to RGB: {rgb_color}")

# Convert RGB to HSL
hsl_color = rgb_to_hsl(255, 0, 0) # Red
print(f"RGB to HSL: {hsl_color}")
```

### Color Analysis

```python
from hued.analysis import get_temperature, is_pastel

# Check if a color is a pastel color
pastel_color = (255, 200, 200)  # Example pastel color
is_pastel = is_pastel(pastel_color)
print(f"Is Pastel: {is_pastel}")

# Check if a color is vibrant
warm_color = (255, 0, 0)  # Example warm color
temperature = get_temperature(warm_color)
print(f"The current color is: {temperature}") # Warm
```

### Color Generation and Palettes

```python
from hued.palettes import ColorPalette

base_color = (255, 60, 52)  # Red

# Initialize the ColorPalette with a base color (RGB)
palette = ColorPalette(base_color)

# Get the complementary color
complementary = palette.generate_complementary()
print(f"Complementary color of {base_color}: {complementary}")

# Generate a random palette, with calculated color schemes, and base color
random_palette = palette.generate_random_palette()
print(f"Generated color palette's base color: {random_palette.get('Base Color')}")
```

> More functions are available for the `ColorPalette` class, including converting all contained colors to **Hex colors**.
